# PRGChess

This repo contains a finished project to "Computer graphics" course at

[Brno University
Of Technology](https://www.vut.cz/en) - [*Faculty Of InformationTechnology*](https://www.fit.vut.cz/.en).

This project is a simple scene renderer of a chessboard scene which is composed of Constructive solid geometry models of SDF primitives.

Scene is stored and loaded from `resources/scene.json` file.

Rendering is using a screen quad and a raymarching algorithm per-pixel in fragment shader using techniques based on awesome blog of Inigo Quilez:
